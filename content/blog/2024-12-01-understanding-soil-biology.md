# Understanding Soil Biology in Reclamation

Soil is more than just dirt—it's a living ecosystem that plays a critical role in successful vegetation establishment on reclamation sites. Understanding soil biology can help operators and contractors achieve better outcomes and close sites faster.

## What is Soil Biology?

Soil biology refers to the living organisms in soil, including:

- **Bacteria** - break down organic matter and cycle nutrients
- **Fungi** - form mycorrhizal relationships with plant roots
- **Protozoa** - consume bacteria and release nutrients
- **Earthworms and arthropods** - create soil structure and aeration

These organisms work together to create a functioning soil ecosystem that supports plant growth.

## Why Soil Biology Matters for Reclamation

On disturbed sites, soil biology is often severely degraded or absent. This happens due to:

1. **Compaction** from heavy equipment
2. **Stockpiling** of topsoil for extended periods
3. **Removal** of organic matter
4. **Exposure** to harsh conditions

Without biological activity, soil can't:
- Cycle nutrients effectively
- Maintain proper structure
- Support seed germination
- Sustain long-term vegetation

## Restoring Soil Biology

The key to successful reclamation is rebuilding soil biology before or during seeding. This requires:

1. **Organic matter** - provides food for soil organisms
2. **Minerals** - supplies essential nutrients
3. **Moisture** - enables biological activity
4. **Time** - allows organisms to establish

Terra Revive pellets are designed to provide the first two components, while proper site preparation and timing address the others.

## Real-World Results

On properly prepared sites with restored soil biology, we consistently see:

- 70-80% vegetation coverage in the first season
- Native species establishing without synthetics
- Sites passing regulatory inspections on first attempt
- Long-term vegetation persistence

## Conclusion

Understanding and restoring soil biology is essential for successful reclamation. By focusing on rebuilding these natural processes, operators can achieve better outcomes, reduce costs, and close sites faster.
