# Stockpiled Topsoil Success Story

A municipal project required the restoration of topsoil that had been stockpiled for three years. The soil had lost most of its biological activity and was producing poor germination rates.

## Challenge

- Degraded topsoil from long-term stockpiling
- Low germination rates (40%)
- Budget constraints for re-seeding
- Need for reliable vegetation establishment

## Solution

Terra Revive was drill-incorporated at 2,000 lb per acre into the stockpiled topsoil. A mixed grass species blend was seeded simultaneously.

## Results

- **Germination improved from 40% to 85%**
- Uniform vegetation coverage across the entire site
- **Saved $12,000** in re-seeding costs
- No re-mobilization required

## Key Takeaways

Drill incorporation of Terra Revive pellets successfully rebuilt the biological function of degraded topsoil, dramatically improving seed germination and vegetation establishment rates.
