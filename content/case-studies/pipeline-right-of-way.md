# Pipeline Right-of-Way Success Story

A pipeline contractor needed to establish vegetation across 50 acres of right-of-way to meet regulatory requirements and avoid costly re-mobilization.

## Challenge

- Large area requiring uniform coverage (50 acres)
- Variable soil conditions along the route
- Regulatory timeline pressure
- Previous contractor experienced patchy results

## Solution

Terra Revive pellets were mixed into a hydroseeding slurry at 1,600 lb per acre. A native forb and grass mix was applied across the entire right-of-way.

## Results

- **Uniform establishment across 50 acres**
- **Zero re-mobilizations required**
- Passed all regulatory inspections
- 80% vegetation coverage in first season

## Key Takeaways

Hydroseeding with Terra Revive pellets provided consistent results across variable soil conditions, eliminating the need for re-work and ensuring regulatory compliance on the first pass.
