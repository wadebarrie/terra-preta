# Oil and Gas Wellsite Success Story

A major oil and gas operator in Central Alberta needed to restore a wellsite to meet regulatory requirements. The site had compacted soil and limited biological activity after heavy equipment use.

## Challenge

- Compacted soil from heavy equipment
- Poor seed germination
- Tight timeline for regulatory compliance
- Previous attempts had failed

## Solution

Terra Revive was applied at 1,800 lb per acre using broadcast application. A native prairie seed mix was applied immediately after.

## Results

- **70% vegetative cover** achieved in the first growing season
- Site passed regulatory inspection on first attempt
- **Closed 6 months ahead of schedule**
- Saved approximately $15,000 in re-mobilization costs

## Key Takeaways

The combination of Terra Revive pellets and proper site preparation enabled rapid vegetation establishment without synthetic fertilizers, meeting all regulatory requirements ahead of schedule.
