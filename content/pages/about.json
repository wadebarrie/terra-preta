  "intro": "Terra Preta Organics develops soil amendments that restore soil function on degraded reclamation sites across Alberta and the Prairies.",
  "storyTitle": "Our story",
  "storyContent": "Soil function is an integrated set of biological, physical, and chemical processes that enable self-sustaining vegetation. When heavy equipment compacts soil or topsoil sits stockpiled for years, these processes break down. Native species struggle to establish. Sites fail inspections. Operators face costly re-mobilizations and delayed closure.\n\nWe founded Terra Preta Organics to solve this problem. Our flagship product, Terra Revive, rebuilds soil biology and structure so native species establish without synthetics. Applied at 1,500 to 2,000 lb per acre, the pellets integrate into the soil profile and support long-term vegetation establishment.\n\nWe work with reclamation consultants, EPCs, and operational decision makers who need reliable outcomes and spec-grade documentation. Our goal is to help sites close faster and reduce long-term liability.",
