# Formspree Setup Guide

Your contact form is now configured to use **Formspree** - a simple, serverless form backend.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Formspree Account
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)
2. Sign up (free - no credit card needed)
3. Create a new form called "Contact"

### Step 2: Get Your Form Endpoint
After creating the form, you'll get an endpoint like:
```
https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123
```

### Step 3: Add to Environment Variable
In your project, update the form submission URL:

**File:** `client/src/pages/Contact.tsx`

Find this line (around line 35):
```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID", {
```

Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Formspree form ID.

**Example:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch("https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123", {
```

### Step 4: Deploy and Test!
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Formspree contact form"
git push origin main
```

That's it! Your form is ready. 🎉

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Set Notification Email
1. In Formspree dashboard, click on your form
2. Go to **Settings** → **Email**
3. Enter the address(es) Formspree should notify
4. Save

**Current setup:** Submissions go to **two** recipients only—**lee@terrapreta.ca** and the primary owner. Formspree’s free tier limits how many people you can notify; **adding more recipients typically means upgrading** (on the order of **~USD $20/month**), which isn’t necessary for now.

Now each configured address gets an email for every submission. 📨

### Custom Subject Line
Already configured in the code:
```typescript
_subject: `New Contact Form: ${formData.company}`,
```

This sends: "New Contact Form: [Company Name]" in email subject.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Test in Development
Unlike Netlify Forms, Formspree works locally:
```bash
pnpm dev
# Form works even on localhost! 🎉
```

### 2. Use Environment Variables
For better security, store the form ID:

```typescript
// .env
VITE_FORMSPREE_ID=xyzabc123

// In code:
fetch(`https://formspree.io/f/${import.meta.env.VITE_FORMSPREE_ID}`, {
```

### 3. Add Analytics
Formspree provides:
- Submission trends
- Response times
- Popular fields
- Geographic data (paid)

### 4. Multiple Forms
Create separate Formspree forms for:
- Contact form
- Quote requests
- Job applications
- Newsletter signup

Each gets its own endpoint!
